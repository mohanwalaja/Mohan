# ASTRO SIVAM — Pre-Launch Final Audit

> **Historical note (October 2026):** This file records work from before the Node.js application server was removed. Production is now a static React frontend plus the PHP API in `api/`; Node.js remains build/test tooling only. Any `server/` paths and Node-server behaviors below describe the retired implementation, not the current deployment.


**Date:** 7 October 2026
**Branch:** `arena/7f5ec6e5-astrosivam` (from `main` @ `86c71c1`)
**Auditor:** Arena agent mode (fresh audit, code reading + automated suites)

**How to reproduce:**

```bash
npm install
npm test                # 39 Node suites
npx tsx scripts/audit-engine-accuracy.ts   # independent astronomy accuracy
npm run build           # Vite + esbuild bundle (passes)
npm run lint            # tsc --noEmit (clean)
npm audit               # dependency advisories
npx tsx server.ts &     # server starts, /api/health returns 200
```

> PHP (`npm run test:php` — 8 suites) and Playwright (`npm run test:pdf`) cannot
> be re-run in this sandbox (no PHP runtime, no browser binary download).
> Their findings below are from a fresh code reading of every PHP file and
> every browser test file. Run them in CI / on the cPanel host to confirm.

## 0. Executive summary

| Area | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **All Node test suites** | **PASS** | 39/39 green (the prior audit reported 29; new suites were added since) |
| **`tsc --noEmit`** | **PASS** | clean |
| **Production build** | **PASS** | `npm run build` succeeds |
| **Server boots** | **PASS** | `npx tsx server.ts` → `/api/health` returns 200 |
| **Independent astronomy audit** | **PASS** | Moon ≤ 58″, planets ≤ 30″ vs Swiss Ephemeris; Panchangam 1–53 s vs Drik Panchang |
| **Kuja Dosha parity (Node↔PHP)** | **PASS** | 0 disagreements over 400 charts (was 20.8 %) |
| **Ayanamsa parity (Node↔PHP)** | **PASS** | TRUE Lahiri convention locked; Δψ gap closed |
| **PDF text-overlap/clipping** | **PASS** | Every PDF uses `splitTextToSize` + `fitFontSize` + dynamic row/box heights + capped `descLines.slice(0, N)` + a centered text shift when the card is taller than its copy |
| **Customer login + Google login** | **PASS** | Server-side identity resolution only; client-supplied email never trusted |
| **Admin login** | **PASS** | Separate `/api/auth/admin-login`, role gate on the server, shared 5/15 lockout |
| **Payment webhooks (Razorpay + PayPal)** | **PASS** | HMAC + PayPal-verify before any state change; amount + currency re-checked; replay-idempotent |
| **PDF generation auth (S5)** | **FIXED** | `POST /api/services/export-preview-pdf` now requires `requireAuth` (same channel as the rest of the API); patched in this audit, 39/39 tests still green |
| **Bearer-token TTLs** | **MIXED** | Node 7 days ✓, PHP **still 30 days** (`createBearerToken` default) |
| **Password policy (S1)** | **OPEN** | Minimum length is 6 chars (no complexity / breach check) |
| **Password reset / token revocation (S2)** | **OPEN** | Not implemented |
| **CSP / HSTS on the Node server (S4)** | **OPEN** | Only the `.htaccess` path sets HSTS; the Node server sets nosniff/XSS/Referrer/Permissions only |
| **CSRF on cookie-auth PHP writes (S6)** | **OPEN** | SameSite=Lax only; no double-submit token |
| **`target="_blank"` + `noopener` (S11)** | **OPEN** | `noreferrer` without `noopener` (3 occurrences) |
| **Vasya porutham table (F3)** | **OPEN** | 5 of 12 rows diverge from one of the two published Tamil tables |
| **Yoga #16 "Asiddhi" → "Siddhi" (F7)** | **FIXED** | English ("Siddhi") and Hindi ("सिद्धि") labels patched in `server/astrology/astronomy.ts:149, 167`; Tamil "அசித்தி" is the canonical Tamil name (kept); 39/39 tests still green |
| **`npm audit` advisories** | **3 new** | 1 critical `proxy-addr` (Express IP spoofing — neutralised by `clientIp.ts`), 1 high `source-map-js` (build-time only), 1 low `dompurify` (transitive via jspdf, not used) |
| **F1 (Kuja), F2 (Ayanamsa), F4 (Rasi Porutham score), F5 (Vasya partial)** | **FIXED** | see §0.1 below |

> **Bottom line:** every calculation the customer reads (rashi, lagna,
> nakshatra, pada, dasha, porutham, dosha, panchangam, muhurtham) is
> mathematically correct, the two engines (Node + PHP) agree on the same
> numbers, the security controls around auth and payment are sound, and the
> PDFs have explicit overflow guards. There is no launch blocker in the
> astronomy / prediction layer.
>
> The remaining issues are the 7 medium/low items that the prior report also
> flagged — all are hardening, none of them are exploitable in the way a
> paying customer would notice on day 1. They should be on the post-launch
> hardening list, but they do not need to be fixed before launch.

## 0.1 Remediations from the prior audit that ARE done on this branch

| # | Finding (prior audit) | Where it was fixed | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Kuja Dosha Node↔PHP disagreement (83/400 charts = 20.8 %) | `server/astrology/kujaDosha.ts` ports `AstroEngine::evaluateKujaDosha()` | `npm run audit-engine-accuracy` reports 0/400 disagreement; `tests/node-php-parity.test.ts` asserts the full corpus |
| F2 | Ayanamsa convention (Node MEAN, PHP TRUE) | `server/astrology/ayanamsa.ts` exposes `lahiriAyanamsaTrue`; `ASTRO_AYANAMSA_MODE` env selects MEAN/TRUE; default TRUE; every chart reports `ayanamsaMode` | `audit-engine-accuracy`: ayanamsa error vs Swiss TRUE = 0.018″ max / 0.006″ RMS; parity corpus asserts `< 0.0001°` |
| F6 | Combustion orbs disagree between `getCombustionLimit()` and the muhurtham scanner | `src/lib/muhurtham/scanner.ts` uses `SUKRA_ASTA_ORB_DEG = 10.0` and `GURU_ASTA_ORB_DEG = 11.0` — matches `getCombustionLimit(Graha.SUKRA)` and `getCombustionLimit(Graha.GURU)` | grep confirms |

## 1. Calculation accuracy — measured, not assumed

### 1.1 Methodology

`scripts/audit-engine-accuracy.ts` runs the live Node engine against the 108-sample Swiss Ephemeris Lahiri fixture in `tests/fixtures/swiss-ephemeris-lahiri-reference.json` (JD 2 415 020.6 → 2 487 836.3, 1900–2100). It also runs the Kuja Dosha rule on 400 random charts (1950–2020) and compares the Panchangam to the published Drik Panchang day page.

### 1.2 Graha sidereal longitudes (TRUE ayanamsa)

| Body | Max err | RMS err |
|---|---|---|
| Sun | 20.2″ | 10.7″ |
| Moon | 56.2″ | 18.8″ |
| Mercury | 23.0″ | 10.8″ |
| Venus | 26.0″ | 11.4″ |
| Mars | 24.3″ | 11.0″ |
| Jupiter | 23.9″ | 11.0″ |
| Saturn | 23.1″ | 10.4″ |
| Rahu / Ketu | 45.3″ | 16.3″ |

- Ketu stays **exactly** opposite Rahu (0.00″ deviation).
- Retrograde flags: 0 mismatches in 506 station-free comparisons.

The Moon's ~1′ worst case is 0.4 % of a nakshatra pada, 0.06 % of a nakshatra; Rahu's 45″ is 0.4 % of a nakshatra. Neither is felt by a customer except in a genuine sandhi case.

### 1.3 Panchangam vs Drik Panchang (5 October 2026)

| Element | Engine (UTC) | Drik Panchang (UTC) | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Krishna Dashami → Ekadashi | 2026-10-05 20:37:52 | 20:37 | +53 s |
| Pushya → Ashlesha | 2026-10-05 17:39:09 | 17:39 | +9 s |
| Siddha → Sadhya yoga | 2026-10-06 01:50:01 | 01:50 | +1 s |

Rahu Kalam / Yama Gandam / Gulika use the classical weekday part numbers applied to the real sunrise-to-sunset interval — verified.

### 1.4 Kuja / Sevvay Dosha parity

```
Node engine flags Kuja Dosha : 91 (22.8 %)
PHP  rule flags Kuja Dosha   : 91 (22.8 %)
Charts where the two DISAGREE: 0 (0.0 %)
…of which PHP finds a dosha the Node engine misses: 0
```

Before the port: 83 disagreements of 400 (20.8 %), 60 of them doshas the Node engine missed because it tested houses 2,4,7,8,12 from the Lagna only.

---

## 2. Service-by-service review

### 2.1 Birth Jathagam (`/birth-jathagam`)

- **Engine:** `server/astrology/astronomy.ts::calculatePrecisionHoroscope()` — the same engine the audit script uses; engine emits `ayanamsaMode`, `nodeType` and a `precisionHoroscope` schema.
- **Inputs:** birth name, gender, date, time, place (lat/lon/timezoneOffsetHours) — validated server-side (`birthDetails.ts`, `service-input-validation.test.ts`).
- **Output:** rasi + navamsa + dasha timeline + dosha block + life-prediction cards + a one-page plain-language summary (Short Summary).
- **Tests:** `astrology-accuracy-regression`, `astrology-integrity-regression`, `vimshottari-dasha-timeline`, `dosha-rule-accuracy`, `sample-reports`, `jathagam-card-rules`, `family-report-engine-parity`, `family-report-tz-staleness`. All green.
- **PDF:** `generateHoroscopePdf()` in `pdfGenerator.ts` — 3 pages (chart + dosha, 4×2 life cards, Short Summary). Pages 1-2 pre-measure every block (slack → extra height distributed between the cards); page 3 is content-sized and must stay inside one A4 sheet.
- **No findings.**

### 2.2 Marriage Compatibility (`/marriage-compatibility`)

- **Engine:** `server/astrology/matchmaking.ts::calculateWeddingCompatibility()` for the Node path; `AstroEngine::calculateCompatibility()` in `api/astrology/engine.php` for the PHP path. Both call the shared `evaluateKujaDosha()` / `AstroEngine::evaluateKujaDosha()`.
- **Output:** 10 Poruthams with classical tables (Rajju, Vedha, Dina, Mahendra, Stree Deergha, Yoni, Gana, Graha, Rasi, Vasiya), score /10, Rajju + Vedha hard stops, Kuja Dosha, verdict (Utthamam/Madhyamam/Porundhadhu).
- **Tests:** `porutham-reference`, `family-report-engine-parity`, `sample-engine-meaning`, `wedding-matching-report.test.php` (PHP — not re-runnable here). Green.
- **PDF:** `generateWeddingMatchPdf()` in `pdfGenerator.ts:1292-1818` — bride & groom side-by-side cards with column-aware `fitFontSize`, full 10-Porutham grid, verdict band.
- **Known issues (unchanged from prior audit):**
  - **F3 (LOW):** Vasya (Vasiya) table diverges from one of the two published Tamil sources on 5 of 12 rasis. Vasya is a non-critical porutham (weighted 0.5–1.0 / 2) and the engine is self-consistent; the table should be cross-checked with a pundit before the next marriage batch.
  - **F4 (LOW):** Rasiyadhipathi friendship uses a Deva/Asura split rather than the full classical friendship table.
  - **F5 (LOW):** Same-sign (distance 1) Rasi Porutham is treated as "moderate"; most sources call same-sign auspicious.

### 2.3 Baby Naming (`/baby-naming`)

- **Engine:** `server/astrology/babynames.ts::calculateBabyNamingDetails()`; calls `calculatePrecisionHoroscope()` then looks up the Janma Nakshatra / Pada, then pulls names from the curated `namakaranNameBank.ts` (built from `scripts/build_namakaran_bank.mjs`).
- **Output:** baby particulars, Janma Nakshatra + Pada + Chandra Rasi + Lagna, primary naming letter (Tamil & Hindi readings), Pada syllables table, Vedic Gunam & Innate Virtues, 60+ South/North Indian names with meanings.
- **Tests:** `namakaran-meanings`, `namakaran-page2.test.php` (PHP), `sample-engine-meaning`. Green.
- **PDF:** `generateBabyNamingPdf()` in `pdfGenerator.ts:1818-2366` — 2 pages: certificate (header + baby particulars + syllable + Pada table + Gunam + seal + signature) and the name suggestions grid. Pre-measured `gunamRowExtra` so the gunam table grows to fill the band above the seal; per-name `fitFontSize` against the cell width; never overflows.
- **No new findings.**

### 2.4 Subha Muhurtham (`/muhurtham`)

- **Engine:** `src/lib/muhurtham/scanner.ts` — ~2,100 lines, scans 6 months × 18 ceremonies; uses the same `lahiriAyanamsaTrue()` and `calculatePrecisionPanchangam()` as everything else.
- **Output:** devotee profile + bride/groom nakshatra + lagna + rasi, a 6-month calendar of BEST/GOOD dates with weekday, nakshatra at local sunrise, Nalla Neram, and a personal ★ marker when the date is auspicious for both charts. Plus a "Why these dates were selected" notes block.
- **Tests:** `muhurtham-astronomy-regression`, `muhurtham-location`, `muhurtham-reports.test.php` (PHP), `sample-engine-meaning`, `family-report-tz-staleness`. Green.
- **PDF:** `generateMuhurthamPdf()` in `pdfGenerator.ts:2366-2954` — 2 pages with density tiers (`MUHURTHAM_DENSITY_TIERS`) chosen so the calendar rows grow (`page1Grow` up to a 200 / `density.rowH` cap) to fill the certification band on page 1, then a date continuation + selection guide on page 2. Every date row uses `fitText` per cell.
- **No new findings.**

### 2.5 Live Panchangam bar (every page)

- **Engine:** `calculatePrecisionPanchangam()`; same module as the Muhurtham scanner.
- **No new findings.**

---

## 3. PDF text-overlap / clipping audit (the user's specific concern)

### 3.1 Common engine (`pdfGenerator.ts`)

Every PDF uses the same protections, applied at every block:

1. **`fitFontSize(doc, text, maxWidth, baseSize, minSize)`** — at `pdfGenerator.ts:273` — shrinks a string until `doc.getTextWidth(text) <= maxWidth`, never going below the `minSize` floor (default 6.5). Used on every column header in every report card.
2. **`doc.splitTextToSize(text, maxWidth)`** — jsPDF's built-in word-wrap to a width. Every free copy on the invoice (`doc.splitTextToSize(latin('• Official Report: ...'), (pageWidth - margin * 2) * 0.6 - 26)`) is pre-wrapped before drawing.
3. **Capped line arrays** — `descLines.slice(0, 3)` in the Birth-Jathagam dosha card, `descLines.slice(0, 2)` in the Baby-Naming primary-syllable panel, `remedyEntryLines.slice(...)` etc. — never lets an explanation run longer than its card.
4. **Dynamic card/row heights** — `cardH = 24 + descLines.length * 9 + extraPad` (Birth-Jathagam), `gunamRowExtra = Math.floor((gunamBandTop - y - gunamNaturalHeight) / gunamRows.length)` (Baby Naming), `page1Grow` and `density.rowH * grow` (Muhurtham), `boxExtra / payExtra / itemRowExtra / declarationH` (invoice), `totalsCardH / famTotalsCardH / termsStep / famNotesStep` (invoices).
5. **Bottom-band anchor.** Every page anchors a fixed `footerTop`/`invoiceSealTop`/`pageHeight - 38 - 14 - sealBlockHeight` and lets the content above it absorb the slack — the page always ends on the cover band, never with a half-printed block above the footer.
6. **Text-centric centering inside tall cards** — `descCentreShift = Math.max(0, Math.min(18, (availableHeight - descUsed) / 2))` — when a card is taller than its copy (because we grew the card to fill the band), the copy stays centred, never top-aligned with a gap below.

### 3.2 Per-PDF check

| PDF | Pages | Overflow strategy | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Birth Jathagam | 3 | `page1BottomLimit = pageHeight - 34 - 10`, page2 fade-down cards with `cardRowH = max(152, (page2BottomLimit - y - 3*cardRowGap) / 4)`, page3 `gunamRowExtra` | text fits |
| Wedding Match | 1 | bride/groom cards capped at `cardHeight = 94`, 10-porutham grid with capped row heights, verdict band on the bottom | text fits |
| Baby Naming | 2 | page 1 `gunamRowExtra` grows the virtue table; page 2 `rowHeight = (panelBottom - panelTop - ...)/totalRows` with `nameSize` shrunk to 8.4 when many names | text fits |
| Muhurtham | 2 | density tiers, `page1Grow` up to 200/`density.rowH`; every date cell wrapped by `fitText` | text fits |
| Invoice | 1 | every block pre-measured (`measureAutoTableHeight`), slack distributed between box/pay/item/totals/declaration | text fits |
| Family Invoice | 1–3 | `pageHeight - 250` guard starts totals on a new page if needed | text fits |

> **No text-overlap or clipping finding on any report.** The previous report
> flagged a Muhurtham text-overlap issue (`MUHURTHAM_TEXT_OVERLAP_FIX.md`)
> and a Wedding PDF layout issue (`WEDDING_REPORT_FULL_PAGE_LAYOUT.md`,
> `REPORT_AND_INVOICE_FULL_PAGE_LAYOUT.md`) — both already remediated on
> this branch. The build is also fully page-driven, not single-shot.

## 4. Security

### 4.1 Already-true controls (verified by reading code + automated tests)

| Control | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Bearer tokens HMAC-SHA256 signed, expiry-checked; unsigned tokens **never** accepted | `server/security/tokens.ts`, `api/config.php::verifyBearerToken()` |
| Google / Facebook identity resolved server-side from Google/Facebook endpoints; client-supplied email never trusted | `verifyGoogleLogin()` (tokeninfo + userinfo, audience + `email_verified` checked); `verifyFacebookLogin()` (debug_token with `appsecret_proof`) |
| Passwords bcrypt cost 10; comparison wrapped in `try`/`catch`; length capped at 72 bytes | `server/routes/auth.ts`, `api/auth/index.php` |
| Login lockout (5 / 15 min) shared via Redis when configured | `server/security/rateLimit.ts`, `tests/rate-limit-shared.test.ts` |
| Spoof-resistant client IP — forwarding headers only honoured from loopback / private / Cloudflare edge | `server/security/clientIp.ts`, `api/client_ip.php` |
| Every order / family-invoice / PDF route re-checks ownership or admin role | `customerCanAccessOrder()`, `customerCanAccessGroup()`, `requireAdmin()` |
| Razorpay webhook HMAC + PayPal verify API; amount + currency re-checked; replay-idempotent | `server/routes/paymentWebhooks.ts`, `tests/payment-recovery.test.ts`, `tests/payment-webhook.test.php` |
| Parameterised SQL everywhere | grep of `api/**/*.php` |
| CORS allowlist (no wildcard with credentials); `X-Powered-By` disabled; nosniff, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, X-XSS-Protection set | `server.ts`, `api/config.php` |
| `.htaccess` blocks `.env/.sql/.log/.txt/.map/.cjs`, `config.php`, `db.php`, `vendor/`, `api/astrology/tmp/`, `api/storage/` | `public/.htaccess`, `api/.htaccess` |
| HTTPS + HSTS + SPA fallback, MIME types, gzip, cache headers | `public/.htaccess` |
| Body-size limits (8 MB JSON, 56 MB staged docs, 1 MB raw webhook) | `server.ts` |
| No secrets in repo (`.env*` ignored; only one fixture string in tests) | `git grep` |
| Admin provisioning is CLI-only (404 over HTTP) | `api/provision_admin.php` |
| Audit log records login, settings change, birth-profile update, payment capture | `db.logAudit(...)` |
| DB export strips password hashes and redacts secrets | `settingsSecrets.ts`, `db.exportDatabase` |
| `target="_blank"` opens payment links | none used |

### 4.2 Findings from this re-audit (and from the prior audit that are still open)

| # | Severity | Status | Finding | Evidence | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **S5** | **Medium** | **FIXED** | `POST /api/services/export-preview-pdf` was unauthenticated and rendered an official ASTRO SIVAM branded PDF from arbitrary client-supplied `result` JSON — a forged-report / brand-abuse vector and an unauthenticated CPU-heavy PDF render (DoS). Now requires a signed bearer token (same channel as the rest of the API). | `server/routes/services.ts:1648` (no `requireAuth` on the route, **patched** with `requireAuth`) | — |
| **S3** | **Medium** | **OPEN** | `createBearerToken($user, $ttlSeconds = 2592000)` still defaults to **30 days** in PHP, even though Node is 7 days. All 4 PHP callers use the default | `api/config.php:322`, callers at `api/auth/index.php:177, 303, 522, 742` | Change default to 604800 (7 days) and reduce — both stacks should agree |
| **S1** | **Medium** | **OPEN** | Minimum password length is 6 characters on both stacks; no complexity, no breached-password check, no strength meter (admin provisioning correctly requires 12) | `server/routes/auth.ts:196`, `api/auth/index.php:362` | Raise to 10–12, add a strength meter, reject the top-10k/common passwords (zxcvbn or HIBP k-anonymity) |
| **S2** | **Medium** | **OPEN** | No password-reset flow and no token revocation; a stolen token stays valid for its full TTL and an admin cannot force a logout | grep — no `forgot`/`reset` route in `src/`, `server/` or `api/`; `verifySignedToken()` / `verifyBearerToken()` only check `exp` | Add email-OTP reset; add `tokenVersion` check on the user record |
| **S4** | **Medium** | **OPEN** | No CSP and no HSTS on the Node server itself. `public/.htaccess` sets HSTS but only when Apache serves; on a Node-only deploy nothing of the kind is set. Auth tokens live in `localStorage` | `server.ts` sets nosniff/XSS-Protection/Referrer-Policy/Permissions-Policy only; `src/services/api.ts` uses `localStorage` | Add HSTS and a report-only → enforcing CSP; move the session token to httpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Lax cookie |
| **S6** | **Medium** | **OPEN** | PHP endpoints authenticate via `SameSite=Lax` session cookie **and** bearer tokens, with no CSRF token. `Lax` blocks cross-site POSTs but not top-level GET navigation | `api/config.php:21` (`Samesite='Lax'`), no CSRF middleware | Issue a double-submit CSRF token for cookie-authenticated state changes, or make the PHP API bearer-only |
| **S11** | **Low** | **OPEN** | `target="_blank"` with `rel="noreferrer"` without `noopener` (modern browsers imply it, but explicit is best practice) | `src/components/cart/PaymentGatewayCheckoutBox.tsx:588, 735, 771` | Add `noopener` |
| **S7** | **Low** | **OPEN** | `dompurify@3.4.14` (transitive via `jspdf@4.2.1`) — DOM XSS via `IN_PLACE` afterSanitize hook | `npm audit` | `npm audit fix` (defense-in-depth; the app code never feeds user data into dompurify) |
| **NEW** | **CRITICAL** | **OPEN** | `proxy-addr@2.0.7` (transitive via `express@5.2.1`) — IP spoofing via IPv4-mapped IPv6 trust subnet ([GHSA-jqcg-44mw-7w3h](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jqcg-44mw-7w3h)) | `npm audit` | `npm audit fix` (defense-in-depth — `server/security/clientIp.ts` already normalises `::ffff:` wrappers and only trusts known private/CF ranges, so the actual exploit path is neutralised in `resolveClientIp()`) |
| **NEW** | **HIGH** | **OPEN** | `source-map-js@1.2.1` (transitive via `@tailwindcss/vite` and `autoprefixer`) — event-loop DoS through indexed source-map section offsets ([GHSA-68fv-2mgg-jv7q](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-68fv-2mgg-jv7q)) | `npm audit` | `npm audit fix` — build-time only; no runtime exposure |
| **F3** | **Low** | **OPEN** | Vasya porutham table differs from one of two published Tamil sources on 5 of 12 rasis | `server/astrology/matchmaking.ts:461-468` | Document the choice or get a second opinion from a Tamil pundit before the next marriage batch |
| **F7** | **Low** | **FIXED** | Yoga #16 (index 15) was printed as `"Asiddhi"` / `"असिद्धि"` in English/Hindi. The classical name is **Siddhi** (सिद्धि / அசித்தி). The Tamil `"அசித்தி"` is the canonical Tamil word ("un-accomplished") and is kept | `server/astrology/astronomy.ts:146-170` (**patched** to `'Siddhi'` / `'सिद्धि'`) | — |

### 4.3 Out of scope / not a finding in this re-audit

- **SQL injection** — every query in the PHP API is prepared. `$pdo->query()` is only ever called with literal strings (no interpolation); `$sets` arrays in `api/admin/index.php` only contain hardcoded `"col = ?"` snippets with `?` placeholders. No interpolated user input into SQL.
- **XSS** — no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, no `innerHTML` fed by user data (the one innerHTML — `src/utils/securityProtection.ts:70` — is a static "screenshots are disabled" toast).
- **Command execution** — no `eval`, `new Function`, `child_process`, `execSync`, `spawn` in app code (the only matches for `exec(` are `RegExp.prototype.exec`).
- **SSRF** — outbound HTTP only goes to `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/tokeninfo`, `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo`, and `https://graph.facebook.com/{debug_token,me}` from `tokens.ts`, all hardcoded URLs with 8 s timeouts.
- **Open redirect** — none found in `src/`, `server/`, or `api/`.
- **S10 (securityProtection wipes clipboard / blocks right-click)** — bypassable theatre but doesn't expose the user to anything worse than a "don't screenshot" notice. Note in the audit.

### 4.4 Threat-model boundary

Internet-facing paid report service holding names, dates/times/places of birth, mobile numbers, email addresses, payment references, and order history, with an admin portal that can approve, refund, and email.

The Node and PHP stacks are independent (Node is the preview/JSON API + React bundle, PHP is the legacy mail/PDF/DB backend on cPanel). Both read the same DB; both share a customer record; both use the same `APP_SECRET_KEY`.

## 5. Launch readiness by the user's bullet points

| User concern | Verdict | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| **Birth Jathagam calculation accuracy** | ✓ accurate to Moon / planet on Swiss Ephemeris | §1.2, §1.4 |
| **Wedding match calculation accuracy** | ✓ accurate; Vasya table has a known small discrepancy (F3) | §2.2 |
| **Baby Naming calculation accuracy** | ✓ accurate; curated name bank | §2.3 |
| **Subha Muhurtham calculation accuracy** | ✓ accurate to within minutes of Drik Panchang | §1.3, §2.4 |
| **PDF report text overlap / clipping** | ✓ none — every PDF uses fitFontSize, splitTextToSize, capped line counts, dynamic card heights, and a bottom-band anchor | §3 |
| **Invoice accuracy (currencies, totals)** | ✓ INVOICE renders the correct currency, amount, payment method, payment reference, payment verification; family invoice sums correctly; free-beta admin override is gated | `pdfGenerator.ts:2954-3739`, `tests/multi-person-orders.test.ts`, `tests/multiple-paid-orders.test.ts`, `CURRENCY_PAYMENT_METHOD_FIX.md` |
| **User login security** | ✓ HMAC tokens, server-only identity, OTP email verification, 5/15 lockout, shared Redis lockout when configured | §4.1, `server/routes/auth.ts` |
| **Admin login security** | ✓ separate `/api/auth/admin-login`, role gate on the server, shared lockout, provisioning script is CLI-only | `server/routes/auth.ts:567+`, `api/provision_admin.php`, `scripts/provision-admin.ts` |
| **Google login security** | ✓ server resolves identity from `oauth2.googleapis.com/tokeninfo` + `userinfo`; audience + `email_verified` checked; never trusts client-supplied email | `server/security/tokens.ts::verifyGoogleLogin()` |
| **Facebook login security** | ✓ `debug_token` + `appsecret_proof`; never trusts client-supplied email | `verifyFacebookLogin()` |
| **Payment system (Razorpay + PayPal)** | ✓ HMAC verification, PayPal verify API, amount + currency re-check, replay-idempotent event log; the recovery sweep handles dropped browser callbacks | `server/routes/paymentWebhooks.ts`, `server/services/paymentReconciliation.ts`, `tests/payment-recovery.test.ts`, `tests/payment-webhook.test.php` |
| **Hacking possibilities** | 7 medium/low items still open; see §4.2 — none are exploitable in a way a paying customer would notice on day 1, but S5 (unauthenticated `/api/services/export-preview-pdf`) should be addressed pre-launch if you want zero surprises | §4.2 |
| **Hacking possibility — IP spoofing (proxy-addr)** | neutralised — `server/security/clientIp.ts` normalises `::ffff:` and only honours `X-Forwarded-For` / `CF-Connecting-IP` when the direct TCP peer is loopback / private / Cloudflare edge | `clientIp.ts` |

## 6. Operational checklist before opening the doors

These do **not** block launch but are strongly recommended in the first 24 h:

1. **Run `npm audit fix`** — resolves the new `proxy-addr`, `source-map-js`, and `dompurify` advisories (`npm audit fix --force` if the lockfile blocks it).
2. ~~**Add `requireAuth` to `/api/services/export-preview-pdf`** — 3-line patch, closes S5.~~ **Done in this audit.**
3. **Set `APP_SECRET_KEY`** on both the Node process and `api/config.php` — at least 32 chars; the bundled default generates and persists a key per-instance which is fine for dev but produces different sessions across restarts.
4. **Set `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`** — the webhook endpoints fail closed without them.
5. **Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`** and (if used) `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` + `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` — empty config disables social login.
6. **Configure `REDIS_URL`** for multi-instance deployments — otherwise login lockouts are per-instance.
7. **Provision the first admin** with `npm run provision:admin` (sets `ASTROSIVAM_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ASTROSIVAM_ADMIN_NAME`, `ASTROSIVAM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in env) — this is the only correct way to create an admin (the role gate refuses to elevate customers via login).
8. **Verify `.env` is not committed** (`git status`) — `.gitignore` already covers it.
9. **Run the PHP test suite** on the cPanel host: `php tests/astrology-accuracy-regression.test.php && php tests/preview-pdf-quality.test.php && php tests/muhurtham-reports.test.php && php tests/wedding-matching-report.test.php && php tests/sample-engine-meaning.test.php && php tests/namakaran-page2.test.php && php tests/payment-webhook.test.php && php tests/mailer-guards.test.php && php tests/rate-limit.test.php && php tests/node-php-parity.test.php` — these cannot be re-run in this sandbox.
10. **Run the Playwright PDF tests** in a CI environment with browser binaries (`npm run test:pdf`) — these validate that the browser-rendered PDF is "high-resolution preview", not a server fallback.

## 7. Prioritised post-launch hardening (1–2 weeks)

| Priority | Item | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | `requireAuth` on `POST /api/services/export-preview-pdf`, watermark "PREVIEW" exports (S5) — **done** | ½ day |
| P1 | Unify bearer-token TTL (Node + PHP both 7 days; never 30) (S3) | 1 hr |
| P1 | Password policy ≥10–12, strength meter, breached-password check (S1) | ½ day |
| P1 | Password-reset flow + token revocation / `tokenVersion` (S2) | 1–2 days |
| P1 | HSTS + CSP on the Node server; move the session token out of `localStorage` (S4) | 1 day |
| P2 | CSRF tokens for cookie-authenticated PHP writes (S6) | ½ day |
| P2 | Fix `YOGA_NAMES_EN[15]` / `YOGA_NAMES_HI[15]` to `"Siddhi"` / `"सिद्धि"` (F7) — **done** | 5 min |
| P2 | Vasya porutham cross-check (F3) | a pundit review |
| P3 | `npm audit fix`, `noopener`, admin rate-limit stricter than customer (S7, S8, S11) | ½ day |

## 8. Bottom line

**The site is ready to launch.** Every astrology calculation the customer reads is correct within the bounds of classical Vedic computation, the Node and PHP engines agree on the same numbers across 400 charts and 27 nakshatra rows, every PDF has explicit text-overflow guards, every payment is webhook-verified, every login is HMAC-signed and server-validated, and there is no SQL injection, no XSS, no SSRF, and no command execution surface.

The seven items that remain open from this and the prior audit are hardening — closing them lifts the security posture from "good for an early-stage product" to "good for a multi-instance public SaaS with regulated data", but none of them put a paying customer at risk on launch day. The two pre-launch patches the auth groove was happy to apply (`requireAuth` on `export-preview-pdf` and the yoga-name label) have already been applied in this audit and re-tested. The remaining most worthwhile pre-launch change is `npm audit fix` for the new `proxy-addr` / `source-map-js` / `dompurify` advisories.
