# Free Beta First Report — Astrologer Chat Access

> Fix date: 2026-10-10

## The problem

During the Free Beta, a customer's first order is created with
`service_mode = 'FREE_BETA'` (amount 0). After the admin approved such an
order from the admin panel, the customer received the report email and the
invoice, but the **astrologer chat stayed locked** for that customer.

Root cause: the approval flow (`api/admin/approve_order.php`) correctly marks
free orders as delivered — `status = 'COMPLETED'`, `payment_confirmed = 1`,
`email_status = 'SENT'`, `email_sent_at = NOW()` — but the astrologer chat
entitlement gate explicitly excluded every `FREE_BETA` order:

* `astro_ai_chat_entitlement()` in `api/ai_astrologer.php` —
  `AND service_mode <> 'FREE_BETA'` (twice: the entitlement lookup and the
  delivered-count lookup)
* the `session` action's report-binding query in the same file
* the "Ask about this report" shortcut in `src/pages/CustomerDashboard.tsx`
  (`order.serviceMode !== 'FREE_BETA'`)

So a delivered free first report could never open the chat, even though the
customer had received the report the chat would discuss.

## The fix

A delivered free-beta first report now qualifies for the source-based astrologer chat
**exactly like a paid order**:

* All three `service_mode <> 'FREE_BETA'` exclusions are removed from
  `api/ai_astrologer.php`. Every other protection is unchanged: the order
  still must belong to the signed-in user, be `COMPLETED`/`PROCESSING`, have
  `payment_confirmed = 1`, no refund, `email_status = 'SENT'` and a real
  `email_sent_at`, and the **7-day chat window still starts at
  `email_sent_at`** and expires the same way. A new delivered order still
  starts a fresh window.
* `CustomerDashboard.tsx` shows the "Ask about this report" button on
  delivered free orders too. The floating launcher
  (`AiAstrologerLauncher.tsx`) follows the server entitlement, so it appears
  automatically once the PHP fix is deployed.
* The generic refusal copy (en/ta/hi) no longer says "paid report", since a
  free report also qualifies.
* `tests/ai-astrologer-access.test.ts` now asserts the opposite contract:
  the entitlement must NOT exclude `FREE_BETA`, and the dashboard shortcut
  must not hide on free orders.

## Verifying after deployment

1. Sign in with the customer account (not admin), open the dashboard —
   "Ask about this report" appears on the delivered free order, and the
   floating "Ask ASTRO SIVAM" launcher appears site-wide.
2. `POST /api/ai_astrologer.php?action=usage` returns the daily allowance
   instead of the 403 refusal.
3. After 7 days from the report email the window still expires as before.

No database migration is needed.


## Reply implementation

The chat currently uses local chart calculations and curated knowledge files only. It requires no external AI service or API key. The source catalogue includes metadata and links as well as a small set of text-read sources; it is not a full-text book corpus.
