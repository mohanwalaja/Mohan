/**
 * Regression test: family members whose Birth Jathagam chart stores the IANA
 * historical (DST-aware) timezone offset were permanently judged "stale" by
 * resultNeedsRecalculation(). Both engines (TypeScript calculatePrecisionHoroscope
 * and the PHP engine) intentionally replace the submitted fixed offset with
 * the offset in force at the moment of birth, so the stored offset
 * legitimately differs from what the customer typed for any DST birth
 * (New York in July: submitted -5, stored -4; Fiji in January: submitted 12,
 * stored 13).
 *
 * The old staleness check required the stored offset to equal the submitted
 * one byte-for-byte, so:
 *   1. the saved chart was rejected,
 *   2. the recalculated chart was rejected AGAIN (same stored offset),
 *   3. resolveCalculatedResult() returned null,
 *   4. the family renderer skipped the member:
 *
 *      "Family package is not complete (3/4 high-quality reports, invoice
 *       ready). Nothing was emailed; retry the render. #ord-5a3e13 (Mohan Ji)
 *       was skipped: no calculated astrology result available for this member"
 *
 * Retrying was useless — the failure was deterministic.
